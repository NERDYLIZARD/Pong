# Poung
A reincarnation of a classic 1972 arcade game, Pong. The game was developed with Object-Oriented C++ and SFML library.

Poung simulates table tennis. The player controls the left paddle by moving it vertically. He competes against a computer-controlled opponent controlling the right paddle. Players use the paddles to hit a ball back and forth. Points are earned when one fails to return the ball to the other.
